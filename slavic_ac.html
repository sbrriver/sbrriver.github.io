						Punishment as it relates to the cultural imagination has evolved dramatically over time, from
						the “eye for an eye” era of retributive justice to the current era of restorative justice.
						Despite societal attempts to break the spirit and use the prison as a place of “living death,”
						life in the prisons gives rise to their own societies, and utilizing Foucault’s “Body of the
						Condemned” analysis on the prison, the way in which the prison is shaped is related to the shift
						from physical violence to one of social isolation, and the resulting in a new form where the
						body is not at center but the psychological destruction and reformation of a person. In “A Day
						in the Life of Ivan Denosovich” by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the society created within the prison
						is explored and in going thru the day, the brutality of the guards and the kindness and social
						development internally is highlighted, as a move away from the violence of the older carceral
						systems. Similarly, in “The Autobiography of Malcolm X” by Malcolm X, life in prison is
						explored, but it leads to the radicalization of X, and pushes him into activism. In reshaping
						the punishment from being physical harm to the prison, society emerges within prisons and in
						these microcosms, the human spirit is stripped down to its most fundamental nature and the
						resulting effect is activism movements seeking rights for all.

						In “Body of the Condemned,” via describing the public execution of Damiens, Foucault points to
						the multiple failures within the retributive justice system, and highlights the growing public
						distaste of violence of that form. “The murder that is depicted as a horrible crime is repeated
						in cold blood remorselessly (Beccaria, 101)” and as the distaste propagates throughout society,
						individuals no longer operate from a position of letting the public harm an individual as they
						have harmed society, but into the prison, to hide and abstract away the violence (Foucault 9).
						The punishment is not gone, but “the most hidden part of the penal process” and in occupying
						this space, serves a multitude of purposes, but enables individuals to claim the morality of no
						longer being complicit in violence, but rather as advocating for nonviolent approaches to
						justice (Foucault 9). Individuals in these cases are willfully ignorant, as there is a system of
						violence both physical and psychological that contributes to the intentional destruction of
						prisoners with the supposed goal of reformation for re-entry into society. The reformation
						however, does not occur, and instead there is ceaseless harm being causes that leads to either
						the experience that each day is nothing but a repetition of the one before, or the
						radicalization of an individual against the very circumstances that landed them in the penal
						system. </p>
					<p>
					<p>
						Foucault’s piece “On the Body of the Condemned,” appeared within the larger collection titled
						“Discipline and Punish” which was published in 1975, is writing at a time after both the
						experiences of Malcolm X and the account in “A Day in the Life of Ivan Denosovich.” He engages
						with a history of punishment and plans forwards the way in which physical punishment becomes one
						of private experiences in the prison opposed to a public act. His set of essays is best known
						for the account of the Panopticon, which was a theoretical prison named by Bentham which
						featured a central observational point and left all the prisoners with the sense of constant
						observation. The structure of the prison and its implications for constant observation is
						present throughout both accounts utilized in the anaylsis of this essay, and both X and Shukhov
						have differing experiences of how they manage these interactions, with X choosing to trade money
						and cigarettes for drugs and other privalleges, and Shukhov choosing to instead hide and try his
						best to remain unnoticed. Both must adapt coping mechanisms in their interactions with the
						guards in order to both avoid corperal punishment and to maintain agency over their lives even
						while incarcerated.

						In the psychological torture of ensuring that years are spent each day a repetition of the one
						prior, the mind fractures and breaks and grows unrecognizable to itself. In the work camp that
						Ivan Shukhov endures in “A Day in the Life of Ivan Denosovich,” he ends the account with “There
						were three thousand six hundred and fifty three days like that in his stretch. From the first
						clang of the rail to the last clang of the rail” and the lack of variety and inability to
						ascertain the passage of time, the mind and soul are broken down and in its place is an
						individual who, in writing their account of an entire year spent in captivity has nothing but a
						recurring memory of horrors and suffering (Solzhenitsyn 193). Prisoners within the camp were
						stripped of any of their individuality and their access to possessions, instead required to work
						and any deviation from their work led to beatings and suffering. They are suffering inside of
						the prison as opposed to being subjected to the public acts of execution or beatings which in
						turn demoralizes the public and results in individuals who despite being physically safe, endure
						hardships and suffering outside of what any one free individual could possibly comprehend. Even
						in walking and aquiring food, one must hide else, “guard would stick to him if he caught him
						again” as he has already been caught to be too slow, and the stick would mean being tortured and
						unable to work which would cause more torture in turn (Solzhenitsyn 19). These systems for who
						is able to get rations and food, and who is able to be out sick are created under the guise of
						being kind and humane, but result in individuals being unable to access proper nutrition and
						rations and subject to near starvation. In treating prisoners like “scum” and arguing that they
						should “feed them on shit” the dehumanization extends to make them objectified as less than and
						stripped from humanity (Solzhenitsyn 14). Foucault’s framework provides tools to comprehend that
						the switch to private torture and dehumanization is one of choice, and preserves the aesthetics
						of being an advanced humane society whilst continuing to brutalize individuals covertly.
					</p>
					<p>

						Solzhenitsyn’s novel is an adaptation of a story he was told by a fellow prisoner. He was a
						prisoner due to his political beliefs as opposed to one of the typical prisoners, and in writing
						his account of the horrors of the prison, he intentionally chose a more identifiable typical
						experience and used that as the basis for the novel. It was censured heavily within the Soviet
						Union and only published after the death of Stalin as media referring to the gulag was not
						permitted. It faced a large amount of censorship throughout its publication history and was only
						finally permitted following the perestroika.

						These covert systems of brutality are present in both the Soviet Union and the US, and those
						systems push X to join the Nation of Islam and later into politics. He joins the Nation of Islam
						following a letter from his brother Philbert and post-conversion to Islam, he becomes a
						political actor and begins his journey into becoming the activist he is best known for. X’s
						conversion to Islam and membership in the Nation of Islam was an essential portion of his
						response to the prison environment and the widespread abuse of prisoners that permeated the
						space. Malcolm X’s life and account were completely shaped by violence, from the very beginning
						of his autobiography stating that “it has always been my belief that I, too, will die by
						violence. I have done all that I can to be prepared” (X 2). The life in prison is no different,
						and utilizing the framework from Foucault, the violence experienced by X is in more private
						settings than that of his father, and his experiences in this private violence are within prison
						systems, as opposed to those within extralegal situations.

						Once arriving at prison, the dynamics of society within bars are put on full display, and he
						experiences the psychological implications of captivity. Within the prison, he becomes reliant
						on drugs and violence in order to maintain any sense of security from the horrors of prison
						life, and lands in solitary confinement a number of times where he would “pace for hours,”
						eventually receiving so much time that he had hit the legal limit and was forced to endure other
						punishments bestowed by the penal system (X 157). As opposed to the prior structure of
						punishment being of the physical kind, he is trapped within the confines of the prison falls
						into drug use as escapism, and engages in the associated marketplace of the illicit trade. In
						response to the various structures of the prison and the lack of liberty experienced there, X
						participates in society to reclaim any agency and control over his life, eventually “gotten
						myself some little cellblock swindles going” (X 158). In the move away from physical violence as
						a response to crime, and into the use of prisons and private violence, these individuals create
						societies within their confinement as a response to the lack of agency present in their lives.
					</p>
					<p>
						The “Autobiography of Malcolm X” was written by X and posthumously completed by Alex Haley, a
						journalist who had interviewed X extensively over the last few years of his life. It covers the
						entirety of X’s life and stylistically works to spread his political ideology. The first
						publication was in ​​1965, nine months after his assassination.

					<p>Both X and Shukhov experience the full horrors of prison and are able to cope with it by the
						creation of society, in the first’s case leading to participation in the Nation of Islam and
						later, political activism, and for the latter, small scale trading and sharing of resources to
						build camaraderie and maintain some element of control and agency. Both figures, despite
						disparate environments and penal systems, develop similar coping mechanisms to the horrors of
						the prison. They both are able to escape from the horrors of the physical punishment, like that
						of Damiens, and instead must reconsider with the psychological one.
					</p>
					<p>
						In shaping these new relationships within the prisons, both X and Shukhov are able to get
						involved in shape their experiences and relationships with others in ways that are different
						from those prior. In the case of X, prior to his experience in prison, he was involved in both
						robbery and drug trade within Boston and was an anti-religious figure. His experiences in the
						drug trade continued into his first year of captivity before reaching a religious conversion and
						joining the society of the prison, and ceasing his efforts to enter solitary confinement.
						Shukhov also undergoes a transformation, where he discusses that he does not even remember
						his wife and has been in prison long enough to become nothing but a prisoner. As a prisoner, he
						too interacts with the large society and is able to build relationships and trade with other
						prisoners in order to maintain some element of individuality within the prison.

					</p>
					<p>
						Prison dynamics are full of horror for all individuals within the system and in effect, they are
						unable to reform or change. Foucault was correct in identifying this shift away from public
						torture, but within the prison, they are still subject to the horrors of captivity, but, in
						reclaiming agency, individuals form societies within these prisons. These societies have become
						ubiquitous throughout the prison, and into the 21st century become the default when it comes to
						the way in which individuals consider the creation of punishment.
					</p>
					<p>Foucault and his analysis did not account for these microcosms, instead theorizing only about the
						relationship between the self and punishment, not for the ways in which individuals are being
						corrupted and turning towards violence and punishment in the face of the prison. The focus on
						death and the body in Foucault’s framework are applicable for large portions of this analysis
						but, in changing and adapting the ways in which both X and Shukhov interact, they are able to
						both engage with the prison and the less corporeal punishment, they are now interacting as
						individuals and making society within prisons. These societies seek to circumvent the
						restriction of liberty that has been placed upon individuals and give them access to drugs,
						cards, cigarettes, and other luxuries that are used as trade. </p>
					<p>
						When one would think that the soul is being corrupted and destroyed, it is being reshaped and in
						some cases, radicalized against the captor in search of independence. The prison is not a place
						of pure horror, but grows beyond into the formation of micro-societies, and these are an
						essential portion of human nature and the ways in which individuals are able to grow beyond the
						confines of their individuality and become something bigger than an individual.
